# Ansible configuration

This is a small project to learn about how Ansible works. This idea (and some of the configuration files) came from [Dustin Krysak's Ansible config](https://github.com/bashfulrobot/bashfulrobot-ansible).

Some manual hackery and ancient trials are required to transfer Important Files that I am not even comfortable sharing where they live, so for now this is incomplete. Eventually though, I will get a Yubikey, which should fix this.
